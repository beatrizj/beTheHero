- **RESTful API design** with Node.js and Express  
- **Relational database integration** using SQLite and Knex  
- **Responsive web interface** built with React  
- **Cross-platform mobile app** built with React Native and Expo  
- **Secure form handling and routing**  
- **Clean, maintainable code structure** following modern best practices
